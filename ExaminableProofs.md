This is page is some brief commentary on what is examinable vs. what is not.  Please ask if something is missing here and you are unsure, or if something is unclear.

Proofs that ARE examinable
=====
1. Instant insanity -- prove whether or not a set of cubes has a solution
2. Determine whether or not two graphs are isomorphic, with justification
3. Determine whether or not a graph is Eulerian (with proof)
4. Determine whether or not a graph is Hamiltonian "by hand"   
5. Proving the Petersen graph proof is not Hamiltonian
6. Proving an Alkane is a tree
7. Proving every connected graph has a spanning tree
8. Proving that $$K_{3,3}$$ or $$K_5$$ not planar
9. Proving a graph isn't planar using Kuratowski's theorem
10. Proving Euler characteristic is well defined
11. Using Euler characteristic and handshaking lemmas to prove graphs can't be embedded on certain surfaces
12. Determining the chromatic number of a graph (with proof)
13. Determining the chromatic index of a graph (with proof, using Vizing's theorem)
14. Determine and apply the chromatic polynomial of a graph (with proof)

Algorithms that ARE examinable:
====

1. Prufer code and its inverse
2. Kruskal's algorithm
3. Upper and lower bounds for the traveling salesman problem
4. Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths
5. Finding longest paths


Proofs that WILL NOT be examined
====
