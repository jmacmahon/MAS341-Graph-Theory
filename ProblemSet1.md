Problem Set 1
----


This problem set does not contribute to your final course grade, but is useful practice writing proofs for the exam.  It is due in class on Friday, March 3rd. 


Question 1

Question 3
---

We saw in class that $$\Gamma$$ has a vertex such that removing it disconnects the graph, then $$\Gamma$$ is not Hamiltonian.  Prove the following generalization:

Suppose that graph $$\Gamma$$ has $$n$$ vertices $$v_1,\dots, v_n$$ so that if we remove all $$n$$ vertices, the resulting graph $$\Gamma\setminus \{v_1,\dots, v_n\}$$ has more than $$n$$ components.  Prove that $$\Gamma$$ is not Hamiltonian.
