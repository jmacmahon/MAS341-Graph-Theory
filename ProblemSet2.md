Question 1
====


An edge $$e$$ of a connected graph $$\Gamma$$ is called a *bridge* if removing $$e$$ from $$\Gamma$$ results in a disconnected graph.

Prove that an edge $$e$$ is a bridge if and only if it is contained in every spanning tree of $$\Gamma$$.



Question 2
===
1. Recall the path graph $$P_n$$ has $$n$$ vertices $$v_i$$ with $$v_i$$ adjacent to $$v_{i\pm 1}$$.  How many different labeled trees have the path graph $$P_n$$ as their underlying graph?
2.  From the Prufer code out of a labelled tree $$T$$, how can you tell if the underlying graph of $$T$$ is isomorphic to $$P_n$$?  Count the number of codes that enumerate such labeled trees, and check that it agrees with your answer from Part 1.
