Question 2
----

Draw $$K_{4,4}$$ on the torus so that no edges cross.


Question 3
-----

The *genus* $$g(\Gamma)$$ of a graph $$\Gamma$$ is the minimum number $$n$$ so that $$\Gamma$$ can be drawn on a surface of genus $$n$$ without any edges crossing, but not on a surface of genus $$k$$ for any $$k<n$$.

Prove that $$g(K_n)\geq (n-3)(n-4)/12.$$
