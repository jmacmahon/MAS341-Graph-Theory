This is page is a brief commentary about what proofs are examinable.  As a general rule, proofs *are* examinable.  There are a few notable exceptions

Proofs that WILL NOT be examined
====

1. Ore's theorem -- you could need statement, but won't have to prove
2. Cayley's theorem -- You need to know the statement, and how to go back and forth between a tree and its Pr√ºfer code.  But you don't need to be able to prove these maps are inverses.
3. Various definitions of trees are equivalent
4. Kruskal's algorithm works -- you need to use the algorithm, but not prove it gives a minimal spanning tree
5. The five colour theorem.  The six colour theorem won't appear on the exam, either, but the techniques used probably will


A not necessarily complete list of proofs you might have to do:

Proofs that ARE examinable
=====
1. Instant insanity -- prove whether or not a set of cubes has a solution
2. Determine whether or not two graphs are isomorphic, with justification
3. A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has even degree
4. Determine whether or not a graph is Hamiltonian "by hand"   
5. Proving the Petersen graph is not Hamiltonian
6. Proving an Alkane is a tree
8. Proving a lower bound for the Travelling Salesman Problem
9. Proving that $$K_{3,3}$$ or $$K_5$$ not planar
10. Proving a graph isn't planar using Kuratowski's theorem
11. Euler's theorem: $$v-e+f=2$$ for a planar graph.
12. Using Euler characteristic and handshaking lemmas to prove something about planar graphs
13. Determining the chromatic number of a graph (with proof)
14. Determining the chromatic index of a graph (with proof)
15. The deletion-contraction equation for chromatic polynomials
16. The chromatic polynomial is a polynomial.
