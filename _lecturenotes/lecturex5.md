Last session, we talked about the torus being the square with its opposite sides identified, and that this gave a convenient way to draw graphs on a torus.

We would like a similar way to draw graphs on higher genus surfaces.


The $$k$$ holed torus can be made by identifying the sides of a $$2k$$-gon.
