\section{Degree for non-simple graphs}
In class we defined the degree $d(v)$ of a vertex $v$ only for simple graphs.  Explain why the definition of $d(v)$ given in class doesn't satisfy Euler's handshaking lemma if the graph $\Gamma$ has multiple edges or loops.  Can you give a different definition of $d(v)$ that does work?

\section{Chemistry }
Caffeine has chemical formula $C_8H_{10}N_4O_2$.  How many covalent bonds does a molecule of caffeine have?

Explain why, under the basic rules of chemistry, you could not have a molecule with chemical formula $C_9H_{10}N_5O_4$.
