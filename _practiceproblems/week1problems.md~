Degree for non-simple graphs
=======

In class we defined the degree $$d(v)$$ of a vertex $$v$$ as the number of vertices adjacent to $$v$$, but we stressed that this definition was good only for simple graphs.  Explain why the definition of $$d(v)$$ given in class doesn't satisfy Euler's handshaking lemma if the graph $$\Gamma$$ has multiple edges or loops.  Can you give a different definition of $$d(v)$$ that does work?

Chemistry questions
=======

Caffeine has chemical formula $$C_8H_{10}N_4O_2$$.  How many covalent bonds does a molecule of caffeine have?

Explain why, under the basic rules of chemistry, you could not have a molecule with chemical formula $$C_9H_{10}N_5O_4$$.

Degree Sequences
======
For each of the following, either give an example of such a graph or prove that no such graphs exist:

 - a graph with six vertices whose degrees are 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2
 - a graph with six vertices whose degrees are 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2
 - a *simple* graph with six vertices whose degrees are 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3
 - a graph with six vertices whose degrees are 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3  (will need the first question)


Pigeon Party
======
Prove that a party, there are two people that know the same number of people. (Note: You need at least two people to have a party.  Obviously.  Use the pigeon hole principle)

Instant Insanity
=====

Solve the instant insanity puzzle.  Copies of the cubes you can cut out are available here: 


Isomorphisms
=====

Determine which of the following graphs are isomorphic to one another:

![One of these things is not like the other ones.  One of these things is not quite the same.](isoquestion.png)
