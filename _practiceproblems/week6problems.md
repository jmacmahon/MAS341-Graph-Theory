Example

Consider the following network:

![Network](WeightedNetwork.png)

1. Find all shortest paths from $$S$$ to $$T$$ and determine the length $$s$$ of these.
2. Find all longest paths from $$S$$ to $$T$$ and determine the length $$l$$ of these.
3. For which arcs (if any) is it true that shortening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will decrease $$s$$?
4. For which arcs (if any) is it true that shortening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will decrease $$l$$?
5. For which arcs (if any) is it true that lengthening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will increase $$s$$?
6. For which arcs (if any) is it true that lengthening that arc by one unit, leaving all others unaltered, will increase $$l$$?
