In addition to being able to draw graphs on the projective plane and the Klein Bottle, the big source of problems this week is applications of Euler's formula  $$e-v+f=2$$.

Annoying to draw
====

Show that $$K_{4,4}$$ can be drawn on the Klein bottle (Hints: may help to draw the 4 vertices in a regular octagon in the middle of the Klein bottle.  Every face will have degree 4).


Proof 1
====

Use Euler's formula and handshaking to give another proof that $$K_{3,3}$$ isn't planar.  (Note: at the beginning of lecture in Week 9 we will use this method to prove that $$K_5$$ isn't planar; if you're stuck waiting until then may help.  The idea is that you know how many vertices and edges $$K_{3,3}$$ has, and since any face of $$K_{3,3}$$ must have at least 4 edges ( why?), it can't have too many faces...)


Proof 2
=====

Suppose that $$G$$ is a connected graph drawn in the plane, so that every vertex has the same degree $$d_1$$, and every face has the same degree $$d_2$$.  Prove that

$$\frac{1}{d_1}+\frac{1}{d_2}>\frac{1}{2}$$

and give an example of such a graph for each pair.
