This page contains all the essential policies for the course.  


Basic facts
------
The lecturer is Paul Johnson.  Email paul.johnson@sheffield.ac.uk, Office Hicks J6b.  

Lectures are Tuesdays at 10 in Hicks LT2, and Fridays at 9 in Hicks LT7.

Office hours are currently scheduled for:

 -  Monday 2-3
 -  Wednesday 11-12

Immediately after lecture is also typically a good time to talk in person.  Office hours may later in the semester, but always feel free to email me questions, or to set up a time to chat in person.

Marking
-------

The marks for this course are entirely based on the exam.  The format of the exam will be slightly different from previous years; in particular, there will be a few more proofs and a few more algorithms.  A practice exam will be made available during term break.

Most likely, one proof from the exam will be a proof done in lecture, and one proof will come from assigned problems; lists of such theorems will be available on the webpage.
