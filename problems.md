Practice Problems

[Problems from a previous year](../OldProblems.pdf)

These do not cover *exactly* the material that will be cover this year, but are pretty close.  

*Excellent* problems to do: 10, 11, 19, 23 (but use nearest neighbour, not nearest insertion, which we didn't cover), 24, 29, 31, 33, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46


Problems to *skip* because we didn't cover:
12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 40.

Practice Exams

[Hacked together practice exam ](../PracticeExam.pdf)

Sorry for the poor appearance; close model to what your exam will look like.  This should also feel quite similar to the last two years exams...



[2014 Exam](../2014mas341.pdf) and [solutions](../ExamSolution2014.pdf)
===

 - 1.ii we didn't cover
 - 2 Feels weird to me -- you *should* in principle be able to do the whole question, and trying it would be good practice.  However, in part because of what I was stressing vs. not, I suspect you would find this question difficult, and I don't think I would ask questions quite like this.   semi-Eulerian/Hamiltonian just means we don't have to start and end at the same place.   
 - 3 All should be doable apart from perhaps iii.  We never explicitly did "the planarity algorith", but this is exactly how we proved $$K_{3,3}$$ and $$K_5$$ are nonplanar.
 - 4 is all good if you do nearest neighbour instead of nearest insertion algorithm.
 - 5 is all good



[2015 Exam](../2015mas341.pdf) and [solutions](ExamSolution2015.pdf)
====

- 1.i we didn't cover.
- 2.i.a -- use nearest neighbour instead of nearest insertion (which we didn't cover)
- 2.ii We didn't do Fulkerson's algorithm, which is just turning the list into a graph, with tasks being the edges.  This particular example doesn't require any tricks, so should be doable for you if you want.  After that, the rest would be fair.
- 3.i we didn't cover directly.  Although theoretically it is doable for you, I think it would be a hard question with what we covered, where if we covered it directly it would be easy.
 - 4 and 5 are all fair game.
