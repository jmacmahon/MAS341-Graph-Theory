Practice Problems
====

[Problems from a previous year](../OldProblems.pdf)

These do not cover *exactly* the material that will be cover this year, but are pretty close.  

*Excellent* problems to do: 10, 11, 19, 23 (but use nearest neighbour, not nearest insertion, which we didn't cover), 24, 29, 31, 33, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46


Problems to *skip* because we didn't cover (although some are nearly doable):
3, 4, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 40.
