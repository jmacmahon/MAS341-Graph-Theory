\section{Question 1}

Each part gives a subset of a commutative ring.  Determine, with proof, whether or not each subset is a subring.

\subsection{1} The subset of $\Q$ consisting of numbers with odd denominators, when written in lowest terms.

\begin{proof}
Recall that a subset $$S$$ is a subring of $$R$$ if and only if it contains $$1_R$$, and is closed under addition, taking negatives, and multiplication.

Let $\mathbf{Odd}\subset\Q$ be the subset of $\Q$ consisting of those numbers which have an odd denominator when written in lowest terms; we show that $\mathbf{Odd}$ satisfies these properties, and hence is a subring.

When written in lowest terms
